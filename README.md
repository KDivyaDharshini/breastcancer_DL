A new use of **Vision Transformers** in breast cancer diagnosis, showing promise in terms of accuracy and 
interpretability compared to conventional CNNs. An important step forward in focusing model attention on 
important areas of images and enhancing diagnostic results is the implementation of the MaskGuidedAttention method. 

Vision Transformers can significantly increase the precision and interpretability of breast cancer detection models
when they are supplemented with specialized attention mechanisms like MaskGuideAttention. This method's 
high precision and recall rates have clinical value and may help with early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.

Evalution Metrics:
In the classification of breast tumors, the updated Vision Transformer design performed well!! 
The main findings are outlined and shown below.

• **Accuracy**: The model's total tumor region localization accuracy was **84%.**

• **Precision and Recall**: With values of **0.83 and 0.91**, respectively, the precision and recall for the malignant class were high. 
                        This suggests that it is successful in detecting cancerous growths, which is essential for prompt diagnosis and therapy.
                        
• **F1-Score**: The model's balanced performance was highlighted by the malignant class's F1-score of **0.87**, as indicated in images.
